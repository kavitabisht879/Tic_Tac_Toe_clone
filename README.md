"I developed a responsive Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
showcasing my proficiency in front-end web development. The game features a clean user interface with interactive cells and dynamic turn indicators.
The JavaScript logic ensures a seamless gaming experience, handling player turns,
checking for wins, and playing audio cues. The design includes a visually appealing victory animation and a reset button for a smooth user experience. 
This project demonstrates my ability to combine technical skills with creativity to create engaging web applications."
